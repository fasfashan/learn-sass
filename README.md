# Learn SASS

In order to learn about the front end, I'm going to learn more about SASS. Wish me luckðŸ¥³



## What is SASS?

Sass is a CSS preprocessor that helps you manage tasks in large projects where the style sheets get larger, you have a number of lines of CSS code, and it becomes difficult to maintain your CSS codes.

This is where Sass becomes useful, as it has features that don't yet exist in CSS like nesting, creating functions with mixins, inheritance, and more. These features will help you write maintainable CSS code.

Sass lets you reuse your code, split it into files, and it also helps you create functions, variables, nest your CSS selectors, and other shortcuts.
